The objective of this app is to understand the basic concepts of a RESTfull webservice, this is only the frontend and the data is consumed from a public API provided by [weatherstack](https://weatherstack.)com/

The tecnologies used on this app are:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

The API interface chosen is "Fetch" instead AJax due to the fact that Fetch already has "promise" implemented, however, Fetch is not compatible with Internet Explorer, hence, this app won't work on it.
